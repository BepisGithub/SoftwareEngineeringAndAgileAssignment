# Introduction
A web app was created as a proof of concept to make it easier for users of Prime Video to browse through all the movies and quickly see information about it as well as reviews that are associated with it.

The app involves a home page that displays all movies in the database. There is a navigation bar at the top that is present on all pages, it includes a hyperlink to go to the home page or to login (or logout, if the user is already logged in). On the login page, the user can enter their account details to login, but if they do not have an account, they can click the link on the login page to allow them to register an account.

# How to run the app and test it locally

Open the command line and navigate to the primeVideoReviewPlatform folder

If you use the terminal to display the contents of this folder, you should see a file called manage.py
